# Energy-Consumption

The project involved the entire data analysis pipeline, from data collection to visualization. It specifically focused on global energy consumption and renewable energy trends, and the findings were presented in a Tableau dashboard for easy consumption and decision-making. This project likely provided valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of energy consumption and the role of renewable energy sources on a global scale. The following steps was perfomed:
Data Collection
   - The data used for this analysis was originally stored in an Excel format.
   - It was loaded into a Python environment using the Pandas library. This step suggests that the data was read from the Excel file, likely in the form of a DataFrame.

Data Pre-processing and Cleaning
   - Before conducting any analysis, data pre-processing and cleaning are essential steps. This typically involves handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency. It may also include data transformation and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - EDA is a critical phase where the data is analyzed to gain insights and understand its characteristics. It often involves:
     - Summary statistics: Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
     - Data visualization: Creating various plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to visualize trends and patterns.
     - Correlation analysis: Exploring relationships between different variables.
     - Identifying anomalies or outliers.

Renewable Energy Analysis
   - This suggests a specific focus on renewable energy within the dataset.
   - Analysis might include examining trends in renewable energy production and consumption, as well as the impact on overall energy consumption.

Dashboard Creation
   - Based on the results of the analysis, a dashboard was created using Tableau. This step involves designing a visual representation of the findings for easy understanding and decision-making.
   - Dashboards typically include charts, graphs, and interactive elements that allow users to explore the data visually.

Visualization and Reporting
   - Tableau is a powerful tool for creating interactive data visualizations and reports. The dashboard created in Tableau likely provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the insights derived from the analysis.
   - The dashboard may be shared with stakeholders to communicate the findings effectively.

Interpretation and Action
   - Once the dashboard is created and shared, it's important to interpret the results and decide on actions or recommendations based on the insights gained.
   - These actions could include policy recommendations, business decisions, or further research.
